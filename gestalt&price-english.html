                            It is a meeting, which aims at preliminary identification of living and emotional situation
                            of the patient, thanks to that it is possible to choose the most adequate form of help.

                            The amount of consultation session is dependent on the complexity of the issue and readiness of
                          the customer to take on next steps. It is however usually between 2-3 meetings.

                        Psychotherapeutic work in Gestalt methodology is all about broadening self awareness through
                        meeting in
                        the ambiance of authenticity and truth with the therapist.
                        It allows for evaluation of self in relation/world, experiencing true self in authentic
                        emotions,
                        the renewal of feeling, naming, sharing, assimilation and acceptance of what is mine. </p>
                    <p>
                        During the work the emotions meet, thoughts an needs as well as the feedback coming from the
                        body.
                        Thanks to the consciousness and experiencing self here and now we are allowed to see the
                        possibility
                        of making choice in agreement with what we need ad the choice of what and how we want for us.
                        It allows for taking the full responsibility for self as well as the creation of life in a full
                        and
                        satisfying way.

                    <p>
                        For me personally, the key aspect of Gestalt approach is the faith in the capability of
                        individual,
                        the ability to support self and making full use of ones own potential.</p>

                    <p>"Be as you are, and so see who you are and how you are. Let go for a moment or two of what you
                        ought to do
                        and discover what you do do.
                        Risk a little if you can, feel your own feelings, say your own words, think your own thoughts.
                        Be your own self, discover.<br></p>
